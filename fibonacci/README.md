## The Problem

For a given input string, we return a how many Fibonacci numbers are contained in it, ignoring repeats.
For example, consider the input `5021`.
It contains the following Fibonacci numbers:
- 1
- 2
- 5
- 21

So we should return `4`. (The Fibonacci number 1 is only counted once).
For this exercise, only consider Fibonacci numbers below 1_000_000.
